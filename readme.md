# Introduction
This sample kit is ready to be deployed and tested.

# Instructions
 1. Copy the *pythonKit* folder(according to your python version) into the root folder of your server (like /var/www/html)
 2. **Mandatory Step**: For each test transaction, please change the value of the parameter "ORDER_ID" in the test.cgi file.
 Note- "ORDER_ID" - Unique reference ID for a transaction which is generated by merchant Special characters allowed in Order ID are: @, -, _, .

# Usage Description
The *pythonKit* folder has the following files:
 1. CheckSum.py – This file has the logic for checksum generation and verification.
 2. test.cgi – This file will initiate the sample test transaction through the Paytm gateway. Paytm parameters need to be added in this file.
 3. response.cgi – This file has the logic for processing PG response after the transaction processing.
 
 # For Offline(Wallet Api) Checksum Utility below are the methods:
  1. generate_checksum_by_str : For generating the checksum
  2. verify_checksum_by_str : For verifing the checksum
  
# To generate refund checksum in Python :
  1. Create an array with key value pair of following paytm parameters 
     (MID, ORDERID, TXNTYPE, REFUNDAMOUNT, TXNID, REFID)
  2. To generate checksum, call the following method. This function returns the checksum as a string.
     generate_refund_checksum(param_dict, merchant_key, salt=None)
